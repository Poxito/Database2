# Database2

The jupyter notebook file (Project.ipynb) is supposed to be launch on the same repertory as the csv file and the owl file.
When finished, the project file should create a serialized file called Trends_file.tll .
We also joined an already created serialized file called Trends_file_already_created.tll .

If needed (for any reason) we joined the csv file directly on the git

The Sparql Queries done on graphDB are joined in the file SPARQL QUERIES FOR THE PROJECT.txt
